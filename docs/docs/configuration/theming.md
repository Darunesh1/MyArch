# Dynamic Theming

The standout feature of MyArch is its **Dynamic Theming Pipeline**. Your system's colors are not hardcoded; they are generated on-the-fly from your wallpaper.

## How it Works

The pipeline is triggered whenever your wallpaper changes (either manually or via the `awww-cycle.sh` script).

1.  **Wallpaper Selection**: `awww` (via `swww`) applies a new wallpaper with a smooth transition.
2.  **Color Extraction**: `wallust` analyzes the wallpaper and generates a color palette.
3.  **Template Generation**: `wallust` applies these colors to various templates in `~/.config/wallust/templates/`.
4.  **Distribution**: The generated configurations are sent to their respective locations:
    - **SwayOSD**: `~/.config/swayosd/style.css`
    - **Hyprlock**: `~/.config/hypr/hyprlock-colors.conf`
    - **wlogout**: `~/.config/wlogout/style.css`

## Component Breakdown

### SwayOSD (On-Screen Display)

SwayOSD handles volume and brightness popups. MyArch uses a custom template that:
- Removes the box background for a minimalist, "floating" look.
- Colors the icons and progress bars using your wallpaper's **accent color** (`color4`).

### Hyprlock (Lock Screen)

The lock screen colors are synced via a dedicated color file.
- The **Clock** and **Battery** label match your wallpaper's foreground color.
- The **Password Input** field adapts its inner color to your wallpaper's background.

### wlogout (Power Menu)

The power menu uses your wallpaper's background with a subtle transparency effect.
- **Buttons** use a darkened version of your theme.
- **Hover effects** highlight buttons with your wallpaper's accent color.

## Triggering a Manual Sync

If you want to force a theme update based on your current wallpaper, you can run:

```bash
wallust run ~/Pictures/Wallpaper/current_wallpaper && killall swayosd-server && swayosd-server > /dev/null 2>&1 & disown
```
